# Web Frontend

## Overview
This skill implements the UI in code with responsive layouts, reusable components, and performance-minded assets.

## When To Use
- Build or refactor the website UI
- Add new pages or components
- Integrate APIs or CMS data on the frontend

## Workflow
1. Confirm stack: framework, styling approach, routing, data layer.
2. Establish structure: routes, page templates, shared layout.
3. Build components: follow the design tokens and states.
4. Data integration: fetch, cache, handle loading and error states.
5. Responsiveness: test key breakpoints and touch targets.
6. Performance: image optimization, code splitting, lazy loading.
7. QA: verify accessibility and visual parity.

## Inputs Needed
- Design tokens and component specs
- API or CMS endpoints
- Target browsers and devices
- Performance budget or Lighthouse targets

## Output Expectations
- Clean component structure with reusable primitives
- No layout shift on load
- Accessible markup and keyboard support
- Minimal CSS leakage and dead styles
