# Web Discovery

## Overview
This skill produces a crisp website brief that aligns goals, scope, and content before design or build starts.

## When To Use
- Greenfield website work
- Requirements are unclear or conflicting
- Scope, content, or success metrics are missing

## Workflow
1. Intake: clarify goals, users, brand, constraints, timeline, and budget.
2. Scope: list pages, features, and integrations in and out of scope.
3. Content: inventory existing assets and identify gaps.
4. Information architecture: draft sitemap and primary user flows.
5. Success metrics: define KPIs and measurement plan.
6. Risks and constraints: legal, accessibility, hosting, compliance.
7. Deliver brief: compile decisions and open questions.

## Intake Questions
- Primary business goal and top 1-2 user tasks
- Target audience and tone
- Required pages and critical features
- Existing brand assets and content
- Preferred tech stack or CMS
- Launch date and budget constraints
- Compliance or legal requirements
- Analytics and conversion targets

## Deliverables
- One-page brief

- Acceptance criteria and open questions

## Handoff
Share the brief, sitemap, and content plan with design and build skills.
