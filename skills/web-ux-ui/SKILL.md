# Web UX/UI

## Overview
This skill defines the visual system and page layouts so implementation can be consistent and accessible.

## When To Use
- After web-discovery output exists
- Before UI implementation or redesign
- When a design system or component set is missing

## Workflow
1. Visual direction: select references, tone, and brand cues.
2. Design tokens: colors, typography, spacing, grid, radius, shadows.
3. Components: header, hero, cards, forms, navigation, footers.
4. Layouts: define page templates and responsive breakpoints.
5. Interaction states: hover, focus, active, disabled, error.
6. Accessibility: contrast, focus order, semantic structure.

## Outputs
- Design tokens table
- Component inventory with states
- Page layout specs per breakpoint
- Interaction and accessibility notes

## Guardrails
- Meet WCAG contrast for text and UI controls
- Keep typography scale to 3-5 sizes
- Limit primary colors to 1-2 and accents to 1-2
